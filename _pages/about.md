<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Shan Jia (Ë¥æÂßó). In Mandarin, my name coincidentally mirrors the pronunciation of "Fake Mountain." What's even more interesting is that my research is closely related to "fake things", including the identification and generation of fake images, videos, audio, and newsüòÄ.

I am currently a Software Engineer at YouTube, Google, working on misinformation and synthetic media detection. Before joining Google, I was a Research Scientist and Assistant Lab Director in the [Media Forensic Lab](https://ubmdfl.cse.buffalo.edu/) led by Professor [Siwei Lyu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~siweilyu/index.html) at the University at Buffalo (UB), State University of New York.

**Research Interests**: Digital Media Forensics, Biometrics, and Computer Vision, etc.
